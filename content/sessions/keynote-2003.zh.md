Building an enthusiastic contributor community is perhaps the hardest part of any open source project. But without it, your project will struggle to sustain itself long term. Although community growth is more art than science, there are some practical things that you can do to make it more likely that people will want to join in. Rich will share some lessons from 20+ years of community shepherding.
任一开源项目最难的恐怕是如何构建一个由充满热情贡献者组成的社区。但如果没有这样的社区，你的项目会为如何长久发展和存续而挣扎。尽管社区的增长更像是一门艺术，但你仍然有一些实战技巧能够让人们更愿意加入社区。作为一个拥有超过20年经验的社区引路人，Rich会分享一些实战经验。
